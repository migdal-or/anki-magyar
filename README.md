Here is the dictionary for the words we have learned through our Hungarian course.

As of 2025-11-24, I maintain 3 files:
- magyar.txt, the one that contains 2 header rows at the top and ~380 rows of "hungarian word" tab "english translation"
- magyar+en.txt, the one above + ~380 rows of reverse "english translation" tab "hungarian word"
- anki magyar.apkg, Anki package ready to import.

## What is Anki?
Anki is a free, open-source spaced repetition flashcard program that uses algorithms to optimize learning and retention.\
It's designed to help users memorize information efficiently by showing flashcards at increasing intervals based on how well you remember each card.\
Clients are available for browser (web) and most major OS.

APKG (Anki Package) files are compressed archives containing Anki decks that can be imported into the Anki application.\
APKG files enable easy sharing of flashcard decks between users and serve as backups. They maintain all deck content and structure, making them the standard format for distributing Anki study materials.
